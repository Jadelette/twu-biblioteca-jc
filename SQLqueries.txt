INNER JOIN book on book.id = checkout_item.book_id
WHERE book.title = "The Hobbit";


Q2. How many people have not checked out anything?

37 people have not checked out anything

SELECT count (name)

LEFT JOIN checkout_item on member.id = checkout_item.member_id
WHERE member.id NOT IN (SELECT member_id FROM checkout_item);


Q3. What books and movies aren't checked out?

SELECT id, title
FROM book
LEFT JOIN checkout_item on book_id = id
 WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT book_id FROM checkout_item WHERE book_id NOTNULL);

Books that aren’t checked out:

Movies that aren’t checked out:
6	Thin Red Line
7	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
8	Lawrence of Arabia

**I couldn’t get books and movies in a single query. Not sure if this is possible, as sqlite doesn’t support right/outer joins

 
Q4. Add the book 'The Pragmatic Programmer',
INSERT INTO book (title)
VALUES (“The Pragmatic Programmer“);

and add yourself as a member.
INSERT INTO member (name)
VALUES ("Jade Corcoran");

Check out 'The Pragmatic Programmer'.
INSERT INTO checkout_item (member_id, book_id)
VALUES (43, 11);

Use your query from question 1 to verify that you have checked it out.

SELECT member.name, book.title
FROM checkout_item
INNER JOIN member on member.id = checkout_item.member_id
INNER JOIN book on book.id = checkout_item.book_id
WHERE book.title = "The Pragmatic Programmer";

Result:
Jade Corcoran	The Pragmatic Programmer


Q5. Who has checked out more that 1 item?
Tip: Research the GROUP BY syntax.

SELECT name, COUNT (movie_id) as movies, COUNT (book_id) as books
FROM checkout_item
LEFT JOIN member on member_id = member.id
GROUP BY member_id
HAVING movies>1 or books>1 or movies=1 and books=1;

NAME	MOVIES	BOOKS
Anand Beck	1	2
Frank Smith	2	1
